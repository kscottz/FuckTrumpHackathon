# FuckTrumpHackathon
Let's Organize to Stop Trump

The goal of the FuckTrumpHackathon is to create decentralized effort to organize and mobilize against Donald Trump and the current administration. Anyone can organize a FuckTrumpHackathon and anyone can participate. Each FuckTrumpHackathon will work to support non-violent resistance to President Trump by providing products and services that aid and support people,
communities, and non-profits engaged in resistance.

In short, the FuckTrumpHackathon is a place where citizens can show up and donate time, resources, and skills to community organizations that are fighting the current administration's policies. It is also a place where community organizations can show up and find people, resources, and products that can help them succeed in their missions. 

# Roles and Responsibilities
- *Customers* - customers are individuals, communities, and non-profits that organize and deliver resistance to the policies of President Trump. Customers bring needs, wants, and ideas to the hackathon and use hackathon products in the resistance.

- *Soldiers* - soldiers are hackathon participants who can deliver tactical, short-term products at the hackathon. Soldiers make the commitment to use their time at the hackathon to deliver products to customers. No further commitment is necessary after the hackathon. No specific skills are required for the hackathon but soldiers are asked to summarize the skills they can deliver to the hackathon. 

- *Lieutenants* - lieutenants are similar to soldiers but make a commitment to deliver and sustain products after the end of the hackathon.

- *Generals* - generals are similar to lieutenants but serve to organize the hackathon space and help to coordinate and organize individuals at the hackathon. Generals are responsible for enforcing the code of conduct, maintaining a secure information environment, and caring for the emotional and physical needs of customers, soldiers, and lieutenants. Generals also maintain a list of products offered at the hackathon and work to provide high quality products.

# Potential Products and Services
Broadly speaking, FuckTrumpHackathons deliver two types of products to customers during the hackathon. Tactical products are short-term products that can be delivered during the hackathon and whose scope is completely achievable within the hackathon. FuckTrumpHackathons also support long-term strategic products whose scope can exceed the duration of the hackathon. Some tactical products can be considered to be components in strategic products.

Examples of Tactical Products:
* Single-page landing pages supporting marches and protests.
* Digital assets supporting marches and protests such as imagery assets, short videos, and the like.
* Marketing and messaging assets supporting marches and protests, such as press releases.
* Physical assets supporting marches and protests, such as fliers, banners, signs, and stages.
* Legal consultations for protest and Trump policy related issues. 
* Security and cryptography consultations for activists and organizers.
* Hugs and love.

Examples of Strategic Products:
* ProtestsNearMe.Today - A website to list upcomming protests in a given area.
* Mimetic Warfare - images, videos, and music that support the community organizations. These assets should be monetized with digital advertising with proceeds benefiting community non-profits.
* IWantToHelp.org - A website where individuals can enter their interests and skills and be directly connected with local community groups that support their interests and need those resources. 
* Protest organization utilities - software libraries and tools that can be used to anonymously organize activism.
